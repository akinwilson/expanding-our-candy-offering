# Expanding our candy offering


As requested, here is the notebook to reproduce all the experiments performed during my analysis in preparation for our discussion.

**Note**
To use the unpacking of the dictionaries within the jupyter notebook; 
`x = {**y,**z}`
You need to be running the notebook with python 3.5.0 or higher.
Do not forget to run the cell installing all dependencies. I.e;
`!pip install -r requirements.txt`
