# Expanding our candy offering
As requested, here is the notebook to reproduce all the experiments performed during my analysis in preparation for our discussion.

<br>
Please see the notebook:
<br>
`investigation.ipynb`
<br>
**Note**
<br>
To use the unpacking of the dictionaries within the jupyter notebook 
<br> 
`x = {**y,**z}`
<br>
You need to be running the notebook with python 3.5.0 or higher.
Do not forget to run the cell installing all dependencies. I.e;
<br>
`!pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br>
If you run the notebook end-to-end you won't need to worry about this. Just be sure to run the cells in sequence. 
<br>
Any pseudo random numbers generated have had their seed fixed for reproducibility. Feel free to clone the repo and run the notebook with your own seeds.
